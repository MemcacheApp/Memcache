## Introduction

Authentication is central to all functionality in Memcache, as one must be registered and logged in as a user
in order to use the app. Saves, collections, tags, summaries, and flashcards are all associated with a specific
user.

Each user has an email, password, first name, and last name. The former two are used for authentication, while
the latter two are used for identifying users in the app.

## Logging in

When first starting the app, users will be greeted with this page, where they may log in to the app.
